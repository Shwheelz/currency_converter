## App notes
This app converts currencies between USD, EUR, and JPY.  The primary purpose of this app was for me to learn Redux, so feel free to make best practice pull requests if you work from this project.

Credit to Jamis Charles from Pluralsight for most of the code.  I made my own style preference changes (in the spirit of learning Redux with as little React as possible).  I followed his tutorial and highly recommend his class if you have a subscription.  Here's his codebase: https://github.com/jamischarles/ps_redux-demos
